# Todays lecture deals with architecture, serialization, local storage (using hive)

Useful links:

* [Serialization in flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/serialization/json)
* [HiveDB on pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/hive)
    - `dart pub add hive`
    - Use `Hive.init()` for non-Flutter apps.
